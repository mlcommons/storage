## Overview
For an overview of how this benchmark suite is used by submitters to compare the performance of storage systems supporting an AI cluster, see the MLPerf™ Storage Benchmark submission rules here: [doc](https://github.com/mlcommons/storage/blob/main/Submission_guidelines.md). 

## Prerequisite

The installation and the configuration steps described in this README are validated against clients running Ubuntu 24.04 server with python 3.12.3. The benchmark script has to be run only in one participating client host(any) which internally calls `mpirun` to launch the distributed workloads across multiple client hosts. The launcher client host also participates in the distributed training process.

Following prerequisites must be satisfied

1. Pick one host to act as the launcher client host. Passwordless ssh must be setup from the launcher client host to all other participating client hosts.  `ssh-copy-id` is a useful tool.
2. The code and data location(discussed in further sections) must be exactly same in every client host including the launcher host. This is because, the same benchmark command is automatically triggered in every participating client host during the distributed training process.

## Installation 
**The following installation steps must be run on every client host that will participate in running the benchmarks.**

### Dependencies
DLIO requires MPI package. 
For eg: when running on Ubuntu 24.04, install openmpi tools and libraries. 

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv libopenmpi-dev openmpi-common
```

Create a virtual environment for package installations and activate it.

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/myenv
source ~/.venvs/myenv/bin/activate
```

### Pip
Please ensure you have the latest version of pip installed. This will fix the following error where the package is built as "UNKNOWN". Upgrade pip like so:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```


Clone the latest release from [MLCommons Storage](https://github.com/mlcommons/storage) repository and install Python dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/storage.git
cd storage
pip3 install -e .
```

The working directory structure is as follows

```
|---storage
       |---mlpstorage
           |---(folder contains benchmark src files)
       |---configs
           |---dlio
               |---workload
                   |---(folder contains configs for all checkpoint and training workloads)
           |---vectordbbench (These configurations are PREVIEW only and not available for submission)
               |---(folder contains configs for all vectordb workloads)
```

The benchmark simulation will be performed through the [dlio_benchmark](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/dlio_benchmark) code, a benchmark suite for emulating I/O patterns for deep learning workloads. [dlio_benchmark](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/dlio_benchmark) is listed as a prerequisite to a specific git branch. A future release will update the installer to pull DLIO from PyPi. The DLIO configuration of each workload is specified through a yaml file. You can see the configs of all MLPerf Storage workloads in the `configs` folder. 

## Operation
The benchmarks uses nested commands to select the workload category, workload, and workload parameters.

### Workload Categories
The first argument is the workload category
 - training
 - checkpointing
 - vectordb (PREVIEW)

```bash
[root@localhost ]#  mlpstorage -h
usage: mlpstorage [-h] [--version] {training,checkpointing,vectordb,reports,history} ...

Script to launch the MLPerf Storage benchmark

positional arguments:
  {training,checkpointing,vectordb,reports,history}
    training            Training benchmark options
    checkpointing       Checkpointing benchmark options
    vectordb            VectorDB benchmark options

```

### Training Category
The training category supports 3 models (unet3d, resnet50, cosmoflow). The benchmark execution process requires these steps:
1. Datasize - Calculate required number of samples for a given client configuration
2. Datagen - Generate the required dataset
3. Run - Execute the benchmark
4. Configview - View the final config

```bash
[root@localhost ]# mlpstorage training --help

```

Use ```mlpstorage training {command} --help``` for the full list of parameters for each command.

#### Data Sizing and Generation

**Note**: Steps described in this section must be run only in one client host(launcher client).

The datasize command relies on the accelerator being emulated, the max number of accelerators to support, the system memory in the benchmark clients, and the number of benchmark clients.

The two rules that generally dictate the datasize are:
1. The datasize on disk must be 5x the cumulative system memory of the benchmark clients
2. The benchmark must run for 500 iterations of the given batch size for all GPUs

If the list of clients is passed in for this command the amount of memory is found programmatically. Otherwise, the user can provide the number of clients and the amount of memory per client for the calculation.

```bash
[root@localhost ]# mlpstorage training datasize --help
usage: mlpstorage training datasize [-h] [--hosts HOSTS [HOSTS ...]] --model {cosmoflow,resnet50,unet3d}

```bash
# TODO: Update

## Training Models
Currently, the storage benchmark suite supports benchmarking of 3 deep learning workloads
- Image segmentation using U-Net3D model 
- Image classification using Resnet-50 model
- Cosmology parameter prediction using CosmoFlow model

### U-Net3D

Calculate minimum dataset size required for the benchmark run based on your client configuration

```bash
mlpstorage training datasize --model unet3d --client-host-memory-in-gb 64 --num-client-hosts 1 --max-accelerators 4 --accelerator-type h100
```

Generate data for the benchmark run based on the minimum files

```bash
mlpstorage training datagen --hosts 127.0.0.1 --num-processes 8 --model unet3d --data-dir unet3d_data --results-dir unet3d_results  --param dataset.num_files_train=42000
```
  
Run the benchmark.

```bash
mlpstorage training run --hosts 127.0.0.1 --num-client-hosts 1 --client-host-memory-in-gb 64 --num-accelerators 4 --accelerator-type h100 --model unet3d  --data-dir unet3d_data --results-dir unet3d_results --param dataset.num_files_train=42000
```

All results will be stored in the directory configured using `--results-dir`(or `-r`) argument. To generate the final report, run the following in the launcher client host. 

```bash 
mlpstorage reports reportgen --results-dir unet3d_results
```

### ResNet-50

Calculate minimum dataset size required for the benchmark run based on your client configuration

```bash
 mlpstorage training datasize --model resnet50 --client-host-memory-in-gb 64 --num-client-hosts 1 --max-accelerators 16 --accelerator-type h100
```

Generate data for the benchmark run

```bash
mlpstorage training datagen --hosts 127.0.0.1 --num-processes 8 --model resnet50 --data-dir resnet50_data --results-dir resnet50_results  --param dataset.num_files_train=2557
```
  
Run the benchmark.

```bash
mlpstorage training run --hosts 127.0.0.1 --num-client-hosts 1  --client-host-memory-in-gb 64  --num-accelerators 16 --accelerator-type h100  --model resnet50  --data-dir resnet50_data --results-dir resnet50_results --param dataset.num_files_train=2557
```

All results will be stored in the directory configured using `--results-dir`(or `-r`) argument. To generate the final report, run the following in the launcher client host. 

```bash 
mlpstorage reports reportgen --results-dir resnet50_results
```

### CosmoFlow

Calculate minimum dataset size required for the benchmark run based on your client configuration

```bash
mlpstorage training datasize --model cosmoflow --client-host-memory-in-gb 64 --num-client-hosts 1 --max-accelerators 16 --accelerator-type h100 
```

Generate data for the benchmark run

```bash
mlpstorage training datagen --hosts 127.0.0.1 --num-processes 8 --model cosmoflow --data-dir cosmoflow_data --results-dir=cosmoflow_results  --param dataset.num_files_train=121477
```
  
Run the benchmark.

```bash
mlpstorage training run  --hosts 127.0.0.1 --num-client-hosts 1  --client-host-memory-in-gb 64 --num-accelerators 16  --accelerator-type h100  --model cosmoflow --data-dir cosmoflow_data --results-dir cosmoflow_results --param dataset.num_files_train=121477 
```

All results will be stored in the directory configured using `--results-dir`(or `-r`) argument. To generate the final report, run the following in the launcher client host. 

```bash 
mlpstorage reports reportgen --results-dir cosmoflow_data
```
