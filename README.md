## Overview

This section describes how to use the MLPerf™ Storage Benchmark to measure the performance of a storage system supporting a compute cluster running AI/ML training tasks.
 
This benchmark attempts to balance two goals:
1.	Comparability between benchmark submissions to enable decision making by the AI/ML Community.
2.	Flexibility to enable experimentation and to show off unique storage system features that will benefit the AI/ML Community.
 
To that end we have defined two classes of submissions: CLOSED and OPEN.
 
CLOSED represents a level playing field where all(*) results are comparable across submissions.  CLOSED explicitly forfeits flexibility in order to enable easy comparability.  (*) Since the benchmark supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow data formats, and those formats apply such different loads to the storage system, cross-format comparisons are not appropriate, even with CLOSED submissions.  Thus, only comparisons between CLOSED PyTorch runs, or comparisons between CLOSED TensorFlow runs, are comparable.  As new data formats like PyTorch and TensorFlow are added to the benchmark that categorization will grow.
 
OPEN allows more flexibility to tune and change both the benchmark and the storage system configuration to show off new approaches or new features that will benefit the AI/ML Community.  OPEN explicitly forfeits comparability to allow showcasing innovation.
 
In a future version of the benchmark, the MLPerf Storage WG plans to add support for the “data preparation” phase of AI/ML workload as we believe that is a significant load on a storage system and is not well represented by existing AI/ML benchmarks, but the current version only requires a static copy of the dataset exist on the storage system before the start of the run.
 
In a future version of the benchmark, the MLPerf Storage WG plans to add support for benchmarking a storage system while running more than one MLPerf Storage benchmark at the same time (ie: more than one Training job type, such as 3DUnet and Recommender at the same time), but the current version requires that a submission only include one such job type per submission.


## Installation 

Install dependencies using your system package manager.
- `mpich` for MPI package
- `sysstat` for iostat package

For eg: when running on Ubuntu OS,

```
sudo apt-get install mpich sysstat
```

Clone the [MLCommons Storage](https://github.com/mlcommons/storage) repository and install Python dependencies.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mlcommons/storage.git 
cd storage
pip3 install -r dlio_benchmark/requirements.txt
```

The working directory structure is as follows

```
|---storage
       |---benchmark.sh
       |---dlio_benchmark
       |---storage-conf
           |---workload(folder contains configs of all workloads)
               |---unet3d.yaml
               |---bert.yaml
```

The configuration of each workload is specified through a yaml file. You can see the configs of all workloads in `storage-conf` folder.

```bash
./benchmark.sh -h

Usage: ./benchmark.sh [datagen/run/configview/reportgen] [options]
Script to launch the MLPerf Storage benchmark.
```
## Configuration

The benchmark suite consists of 3 distinct phases

1. Synthetic data is generated based on the workload requested by the user.

```bash
./benchmark.sh datagen -h

Usage: ./benchmark.sh datagen [options]
Generate benchmark dataset based on the specified options.


Options:
  -h, --help			Print this message
  -c, --category		Benchmark category to be submitted. Possible options are 'closed'(default)
  -w, --workload		Workload dataset to be generated. Possible options are 'unet3d', 'bert'
  -n, --num-parallel		Number of parallel jobs used to generate the dataset
  -r, --results-dir		Location to the results directory. Default is ./results/workload.model/DATE-TIME
  -p, --param			DLIO param when set, will override the config file value
```

Example:

For generating training data for `unet3d` workload into `unet3d_data` directory with 10 subfolders using 8 parallel jobs, 

```bash
./benchmark.sh datagen --workload unet3d --num-parallel 8 --param dataset.num_subfolders_train=10 --param dataset.data_folder=unet3d_data
```

2. Benchmark is run on the generated data. Device stats are collected continuously using iostat profiler during the benchmark run.

```bash
./benchmark.sh run -h

Usage: ./benchmark.sh run [options]
Run benchmark on the generated dataset based on the specified options.


Options:
  -h, --help			Print this message
  -c, --category		Benchmark category to be submitted. Possible options are 'closed'(default)
  -w, --workload		Workload to be run. Possible options are 'unet3d', 'bert'
  -g, --accelerator-type	Simulated accelerator type used for the benchmark. Possible options are 'v100-32gb'(default)
  -n, --num-accelerators	Simulated number of accelerators of same accelerator type
  -r, --results-dir		Location to the results directory. Default is ./results/workload.model/DATE-TIME
  -p, --param			DLIO param when set, will override the config file value
```

Example:

For running benchmark on `unet3d` workload with data located in `unet3d_data` directory using 4 accelerators and results on `unet3d_results` directory , 

```bash
./benchmark.sh run --workload unet3d --num-accelerators 4 --results-dir unet3d_results --param dataset.data_folder=unet3d_data
```

3. Reports are generated from the benchmark results

```bash
./benchmark.sh reportgen -h

Usage: ./benchmark.sh reportgen [options]
Generate a report from the benchmark results.


Options:
  -h, --help			Print this message
  -r, --results-dir		Location to the results directory
```

## Workloads
Currently, the storage benchmark suite supports benchmarking of 3 deep learning workloads
- Image segmentation using U-Net3D model ([unet3d](./storage-conf/workloads/unet3d.yaml))
- Natural language processing using BERT model ([bert](./storage-conf/workloads/bert.yaml))
- Recommendation using DLRM model (TODO)

### U-Net3D Workload

Generate data for the benchmark run

```bash
./benchmark.sh datagen --workload unet3d --num-parallel 8
```
  
Flush the filesystem caches before benchmark run

```bash
sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```
  
Run the benchmark.

```bash
./benchmark.sh run --workload unet3d --num-accelerators 8
```

All results will be stored in ```results/unet3d/$DATE-$TIME``` folder or in the directory when overriden using `--results-dir`(or `-r`) argument. To generate the final report, one can do

```bash 
./benchmark.sh reportgen --results-dir results/unet3d/$DATE-$TIME
```
This will generate ```DLIO_$model_report.txt``` in the output folder. 

### BERT Workload

Generate data for the benchmark run

```bash
./benchmark.sh datagen --workload bert --num-parallel 8
```
  
Flush the filesystem caches before benchmark run
```bash
sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```
  
Run the benchmark
```bash
./benchmark.sh run --workload bert --num-accelerators 8
```

All results will be stored in ```results/bert/$DATE-$TIME``` folder or in the directory when overriden using `--results-dir`(or `-r`) argument. To generate the final report, one can do

```bash 
./benchmark.sh reportgen -r results/bert/$DATE-$TIME
```
This will generate ```DLIO_$model_report.txt``` in the output folder. 


### DLRM Workload

To be added
